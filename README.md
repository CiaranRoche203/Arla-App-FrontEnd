### About

The project that was undertaken is called “Alumni Registration
and Linking Application” also known as Arla. What is Arla? It is an appli-
cation that was originally intended to be developed on behalf of the college
itself. The original idea was that GMIT was to use it on their website. Arla
is where users can sign up and login to the system, add information to their
profile and create connections with other users using the messenger part of
the application

### Running the Application
The application is hosted on Heroku and is available at https://arl-application.herokuapp.com/
